        <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
        <p>
          And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed
          and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For
          behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual;
          and if they hold out cfaithful to the end they are received into
          heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of
          never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are
          true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.

        <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
        <p>
          And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give
          unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient
          for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble
          themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak
          things become strong unto them.
